**Appendix B: Decision-Making Guidelines**

**Purpose of the Guidelines**

1. To ensure harmony, efficient and smooth running of all components of the Society at all levels.
2. To ensure the leaders and members of the Society uphold the Dhamma in every level of activity, without swerving from its original aims both in seeking the means and achieving the ends of any plan or activity of the Society.

**Guidelines**

1. **Dhammocracy**

	"Dhammocracy" is adhering to the Dhamma in all aspects of life, leadership, organization and any human activity, directly or indirectly involved by the Society’s leaders and members. Any IAPT member or non-member may alert the Society of any Dhamma consideration at any level of activity. Such alerts must be given due consideration by properly searching the Dhamma laid out in the Pāli Tipitaka, its Commentary and Sub-Commentary.

2. **Meritocracy**

	"Meritocracy" is adhering to the principle that the decision of the experienced Nāyaka (Rattaññunāyaka) or the Teacher responsible in the particular issue prevails. AFTER having ascertained that certain issues are unrelated with or in no contradiction or violation to the Dhammavinaya or Dhammavinaya principles, the Society shall decide by respecting the decision of the related Nāyaka or Teacher. In situations where both are not available, the decision of majority would be resorted to.

3. **Right of Speech and Expression**

	Right of Speech and Expression is the prerogative of those who are able to maintain calm, peaceful demeanour and rational attitude. At any level of activity in the Society, if any person falls into emotional imbalance and fails to be calm and peaceful, he should temporarily self-suspend his right of speech and expression until objectively perceivable calm, peace and rationality is restored into his heart and mind. Surrounding people have the responsibility to leave him alone and let him calm down himself to avoid regrettable acts or decisions. Words uttered in emotional outbursts must not be taken into account, either for or against him.

4. **Powers and Authorities Not to be Craved**

	One should exercise one’s powers and authorities only when one is invited by the Society. All initiatives to quest for powers and authorities should be seen as violation of the principle of service in the Society. One’s Dhamma qualities and abilities will be recognized and sought for when one has performed selfless service in the Society for a long time. However, taking initiative to contribute services in a peaceful manner without getting into conflicts and competition for authority should be encouraged.

5. **Selfless Principle**

	All services and contributions must be performed with a selfless attitude, only for Dhamma and spiritual welfare of oneself and others. No selfish worldly gains such as name and fame, personal glory can be sought by anybody in the Society. Even when one fails to keep up perfect selflessness in mind, one must not perpetuate one’s own imperfection, much less exerting wrong attitude and values. For example, one must not directly or indirectly cause others to do something to please one’s ego.

6. **Sangha Committee’s Guidance**

	In all Dhamma-related matters, including those involving the Sangha, the Sayalays, and all meditators, in matters of meditation and Dhamma teaching, Sangha Committee’s guidance and decision should be respected as final.

7. **No Ego Appeasement**

	Conquering of ego is a major part of spiritual training in the Dhamma-Vinaya. Therefore for all purposes of management and administration, Sangha Committee, the Committee and all subsidiary authorities in the Society shall not limit their freedom and efficacy of action by acting to appease the ego of any individual member. Leniency should be granted to outsiders who are new and have not submitted to the Dhamma-Vinaya training.

8. **Gentle and Humane Approach**

	In all dealings in the Society, especially regarding disciplinary actions, the Society should always try to apply gentle and humane approach in the spirit of Brahmavihara without compromising the correctness and firmness in the Dhamma-Vinaya.

9. **Alternative Thinking**

	In decision-making, the Society should always consider alternative options to any primary option, weighing the costs and benefits of each of the alternatives before making decision.

10. **Marginal Thinking**

	The marginal costs / benefits differences between close options should be identified in order to know the relevant difference between options.

11. **Relevance thinking**

	All brainstorming, discussions, considerations and decision-making should be guided by the principle of relevance to avoid the inefficiency of being distracted by irrelevant or petty concerns.

12. **Four Clear Comprehensions**

	In management and administration, the Society should be guided by…

    1. Clear Comprehension of Purpose
    2. Clear Comprehension of Suitability
    3. Clear Comprehension of Domain
    4. Clear Comprehension of Non-Delusion

13. **Balancing Wisdom and Compassion**

	For the purpose of implementing Dhamma propagation programs, Wisdom refers to the ability to know and adhere to Truth, utilize relevant conditions and to achieve goals while Compassion refers to the heart to alleviate the sufferings of all beings. Wisdom and compassion is most balance in application when the total welfare of all is optimized in the long-run.

14. **Reality Motivation**

	Let the realities of life—birth, old age, sickness, death…the sufferings caused by ignorance，wrong views and craving…be constantly kept in mind. Let realities, the sufferings of others and oneself in the rounds of Samsara, be the motivators for all Dhamma works.

15. **The Main Powers in Dhamma Leadership**

	1. Dhamma Powers

	Truths/Realities (Ultimate and Conventional), Principles, Methods，spiritual qualities and attainments of spiritual community

	2. Vinaya Powers

		Buddha’s Rules, Traditions, Culture, Laws, Systems，good conducts of spiritual community

	3. Power of Real Benefits

		Less sufferings, more peace and happiness

	4. Power of Unity and Harmony

		1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+…+n =1111111111n----Unite Dhamma, talents, merits and resources…where n equals to infinity.

	5. Power of Selfless and Compassionate Sacrifice

16. **Safeguards**

    1.  Powers and authorities including temporary positions or platforms to exercise influence must always be safeguarded and can only be entrusted to long time tested individuals.

    2.  Entrusting and empowering process must be gradual, systematic and stage by stage without any craving for quick results.

    3.  There can be no haphazard entering into any state which may carry serious consequences. There must be readiness to handle the worst possible outcome.

    4.  Rendering opportunity and help to people with unknown or questionable track record must always be done with proper safeguards, giving due consideration to failure of trust.

    5.  People who propose to reinstate or entrust those with questionable track record has a duty to satisfy the community, especially Sangha Committee and Committee of their readiness to handle and bear the outcome in case of such failure.
