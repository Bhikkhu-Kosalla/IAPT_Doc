- - Appendix B: Decision-Making Guidelines

Purpose of the Guidelines

To ensure harmony, efficiency, and smooth running of all components of the Society at all levels. 
To ensure the leaders and the Society's members uphold the Dhamma in every level of activity, without swerving from its original aims both in seeking the means and achieving the ends of any plan or activity of the Society. 

Guidelines

	"Dhammocracy"

"Dhammocracy" adheres to the Dhamma in all aspects of life, leadership, organization, and any human activity, directly or indirectly involved by the Society's leaders and members. Any IAPT member or non-member may alert the Society of any Dhamma consideration at any level of activity. Such alerts must be given due consideration by properly searching the Dhamma laid out in the Pāli Tipitaka, its Commentary, and Sub-Commentary. 

	Meritocracy

"Meritocracy" is adhering to the principle that the decision of the experienced Nāyaka (Rattaññunāyaka) or the Teacher responsible in a specific issue prevails. AFTER having ascertained that particular issues are unrelated with or in no contradiction or violation to the Dhammavinaya or Dhammavinaya principles, the Society shall decide by respecting the decision of the related Nāyaka or Teacher. In situations where both are not available, the decision of the majority would apply.

	Right of Speech and Expression

The Right of Speech and Expression is the prerogative of those who can maintain a calm, peaceful demeanor and rational attitude. At any level of activity in the Society, if any person falls into emotional imbalance and fails to be calm and peaceful, he should temporarily self-suspend his right of speech and expression until objectively perceivable calm, peace and rationality are restored into his heart and mind. Surrounding people have the responsibility to leave him alone and let him calm himself down to avoid regrettable acts or decisions. Words uttered in emotional outbursts must not be taken into account, either for or against him. 

	Powers and Authorities Not to be Craved

One should exercise one's powers and authority only when the Society invites one. All initiatives for powers and authorities should is considered a violation of the Society's principle. One's Dhamma qualities and abilities will be recognized and sought when one has performed selfless service in the Society for a long time. However, taking the initiative to contribute peacefully without getting into conflicts and competition for authority should be encouraged.

	Selfless Principle

All services and contributions must be performed with a selfless attitude, only for the Dhamma, oneself, and others' spiritual welfare. No selfish worldly gains such as name and fame, personal glory can be sought by anybody in the Society. Even when one fails to keep up perfect selflessness in mind, one must not perpetuate one's imperfection, much less exerting wrong attitude and values. For example, one must not directly or indirectly cause others to do something to please one's ego. 

	Sangha Committee's Guidance

In all Dhamma-related matters, including those involving the Sangha, the nuns, and all meditators, in matters of meditation and Dhamma teaching, the Sangha Committee's guidance and decisions should be respected as final. 

	No Ego Appeasement

The conquering of the ego is a significant part of spiritual training in the Dhamma-Vinaya. Therefore, for all purposes of management and administration, Sangha Committee, the Committee, and all subsidiary authorities in the Society shall not limit their freedom and efficacy of action by acting to appease any individual member's ego. Leniency should be granted to outsiders who are new and have not submitted to the Dhamma-Vinaya training. 

	Gentle and Humane Approach

In all dealings in the Society, especially regarding disciplinary actions, the Society should always try to apply a gentle and humane approach in the spirit of Brahmavihara without compromising the correctness and firmness in the Dhamma-Vinaya. 

	Alternative Thinking

In decision-making, the Society should always consider alternative options to any primary option, weighing each of the alternatives' costs and benefits before making decisions. 

	Marginal Thinking

The marginal costs/benefits differences between close options should be identified to know the relevant difference between options. 

	Relevance thinking

All brainstorming, discussions, considerations, and decision-making should refer to the principle of relevance to avoid the inefficiency of being distracted by irrelevant or petty concerns. 
	Four Clear Comprehensions

In management and administration, the Society should be guided by:

Clear Comprehension of Purpose 
Clear Comprehension of Suitability 
Clear Comprehension of Domain 
Clear Comprehension of Non-Delusion

	Balancing Wisdom and Compassion

In implementing Dhamma propagation programs, wisdom refers to knowing and adhering to Truth, utilizing relevant conditions, and achieving goals, while compassion refers to the heart to alleviate all beings' sufferings. Wisdom and compassion are most balanced in exercise when the total welfare of all is optimized in the long-run. 

	Reality Motivation

Let the realities of life—birth, old age, sickness, death…, the sufferings caused by ignorance, wrong views, and craving…, be continuously kept in mind. Let realities, the sufferings of others and oneself in the rounds of Samsara, be the motivators for all Dhamma works. 

	The Main Powers in Dhamma Leadership 

Dhamma Powers

Truths/Realities (Ultimate and Conventional), Principles, Methods，spiritual qualities and attainments of spiritual community

Vinaya Powers

Buddha's Rules, Traditions, Culture, Laws, Systems，good conducts of spiritual community
Power of Real Benefits
Fewer sufferings, more peace, and happiness
Power of Unity and Harmony
1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+…+n =1111111111n----Unite Dhamma, talents, merits and resources…where n equals to infinity.
Power of Selfless and Compassionate Sacrifice

	Safeguards

Powers and authorities, including temporary positions or platforms to exercise influence, must always be safeguarded and can only be entrusted to long-time-tested individuals. 

Entrusting and empowering process must be gradual, systematic, and stage by stage without any craving for quick results. 
There can be no haphazard entering into any state, which may carry serious consequences. There must be a readiness to handle the worst possible outcome.

Rendering opportunity and help to people with unknown or questionable track records must always be done with proper safeguards, giving due consideration to trust failure.

People who propose to reinstate or entrust those with questionable track records must satisfy the community, especially the Sangha Committee and Committee, of their readiness to handle and bear the outcome in case of such failure.
